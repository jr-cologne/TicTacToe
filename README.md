# TicTacToe
A simple TicTacToe for the console written in C.

## Getting Started

You want to play a round? Just download the zip file, unzip it and run `TicTacToe.exe`!

Or do you even want to code a little bit to improve the game? Then feel free to open up `main.c` in your favourite text editor or IDE, make your changes, compile everything and finally enjoy your own version of the game.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this project! It would be awesome for me if somebody contributes to it.

So don't be shy and start coding! If you want to make sure that I like your idea, you can contact me by a Issue.

But if you decide to contribute to this project, keep in mind that finally it is my choice to merge your Pull Request or not, so also be prepared for a negative decision.
